- if workorder-startdate is null then workorder-status must be 0 (Not_Started)

- if operation-startdate is null then operation-status must be 0 (Not_Started)

- user can not create more than 1 work-order for any customer-order

- workorder-operation combination is UNIQUE

- when workorder is Start_Running,,, then and then 
operation can be any of (Start_Running, Pause_Running, Completed, Can_Not_Complete) 

- once operation-startdate is not null && operation-status != Not_Started,,,
then user can not do [ operation-startdate is null or operation-status == Not_Started ]

- once workorder-startdate is not null && workorder-status != Not_Started,,,
then user can not do [ workorder-startdate is null or workorder-status == Not_Started ]

- workorder-startdate must be <= it's any of operations'-startdate

- workorder-startdate must be >= it's customerorder's order-date

- if operation is Not_Started then,,,
it can not be Completed directly means operation must follow,,,
Not_Started -> Start_Running -> Completed sequence

- when OpQTYDone>=OpQTYRequired then,,,
		- this operation-status can become operation-status-completed
- when operation-status-completed by supervisor then,,,
	- operator can not do either operation-status-start_running or operation-status-pause_running
- when operation-pause-running by supervisor then,,,
	- operator can not do either operation-status-start_running or operation-status-pause_running
- when all operations for any workorder become
	operation-status-completed then,,,
		- workorder-status can become workorder-status-completed
- when workorder-status-completed by supervisor then,,,
	- it's any operations can not be anything except operation-status-completed

[Supervisor]
- operation-startdate = first time when operation starts
- operation-enddate = when operation ends

- workorder-startdate = first time when workorder starts
- workorder-enddate = when workorder ends


[Operator]							
- operator can select 
	workorder, 
	operation-id / operation number,
	operation-status (start-running/pause-running),
		- start-running 
			- Can not enter OpQtyDone
			- operation-start-run-time (auto(system date-time) - operator can not change time)
		- pause-running 
			- Must enter OpQtyDone
			- operation-pause-run-time (auto(system date-time) - operator can not change time)
